Report a bug
============

The Fridge team does her best to provide a functional library but we are simple humans... If you find a bug, we really
encourage you to report it. It helps us make it better.

.. caution::

    If you think you have found a security issue, use this specific :doc:`procedure <security>` instead.

If you think you have found a bug, first:

* Check the `documentation`_ to figure out if you're not misusing the library.

If your problem really looks like a bug, report it on the bug `tracker`_ and follow these simple rules:

* Use the title field to clearly describe the issue.
* Try to provide a unit test which illustrates the bug. If you can't, describe needed steps to reproduce the bug
  (code examples are welcome).
* Give as much details as possible about your environment (OS, PHP version, ...).
