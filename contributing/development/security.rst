Report a security issue
=======================

If you find a security issue in the library, please **don't report it on the bug tracker**. All security issues must be
sent to **security [at] fridge-project.org** instead. Emails sent to this address are forwarded to the Fridge team
private mailing-list.

For each report, we always try to confirm the vulnerability. If it is confirmed, the team works on a solution following
these steps:

1. Send an acknowledge to the reporter.
2. Work on a patch with the reporter if he wants to contribute.
3. Write a post describing the vulnerability, the possible exploits, and how to patch/upgrade affected applications.
4. Apply the patch to all maintained versions of the library.
5. Publish the post on the Fridge `blog`_.

.. note::

    While we are working on a patch, please do not reveal the issue publicly.
